# MyFirefoxConf
My current configuration on Firefox.

# user.js
Waterfall base, with a few overrides.

Installation

Enable the option toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets from your about:config or user.js file. Then open your profile folder (you can find the location in about:profiles), create the folder chrome inside of it, and place the userChrome.css file inside.

Any theme and density should work, but the theme is meant to be used with Firefox's default Dark theme (not the System theme) and Compact density (enabled with the option browser.compactmode.show in about:config).
